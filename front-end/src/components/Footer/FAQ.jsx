                Currently, orders can take 1-4 business days to process before
                shipping. From there, shipping times are dependent upon
                location. Check out our shipping page for more information on
                when to expect your package. Note: FedEx and USPS are
                experiencing some transit delays. Tracking details may be slower
                than normal to update. Please allow for additional time for all
                deliveries. Thanks for bearing with us!

                Oh no! We’re sorry to hear that. Our shipping carriers work
                independently from American Apparel, but here are a few
                solutions we can offer: If your package has been marked
                delivered and it's only been a day or two, sit tight! Sometimes
                the carriers scan it before it gets to you. Keep an eye out for
                it in the next few hours. If the tracking hasn’t been updated in
                an unusually long time or if it was never updated since the
                label was created, chances are it was lost in transit. Please
                send an email to blue@unitedbyblue.com so we can help you look
                into this. If the shipping address was a temporary location, we
                do not assume responsibility if the recipient is no longer at
                that address upon delivery within the projected shipping
                timeline. Customer support must be notified of any lost packages
                within 30 days of the ship date. If a package is not reported as
                lost within 30 days of the ship date, customer service will not
                be able to assist with a replacement or refund.

                Most American Apparel products are guaranteed for 30 days after
                purchase date. If any issues arise during that time, the item
                can be returned for a refund or exchange. Items must have been
                purchased from American Apparel and must be returned in their
                original condition and packaging (unwashed, unworn, and tags
                still attached). If used items are returned, a partial refund
                may be given in the form of store credit.
